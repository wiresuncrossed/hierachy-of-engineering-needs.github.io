Based on years of working towards and achieving continuous delivery (routine 1+ daily production deploys) with hundreds of teams and thousands of Engineers worldwide, we have created a living model to help organisations assess and understand what constraints are the best problems to solve across architecture, cloud-native, development, operations, engineering culture, operating models, governance and team experience.

​![Hierarchy of Engineeering Needs - Overview](./assets/hoen_overview.svg)

The Hierarchy of Engineering Needs (HoEN) model combines Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory with industry research and our combined lived experience to galvanise action. 
Just as Maslow’s theory suggests that fundamental human needs must be met before pursuing higher level growth, the HoEN framework outlines the Basic Needs for releasing and deploying software, upon which higher order engineering needs are built in the pursuit to optimise the flow of high quality valuable software.

Investing in the maturity of lower level needs should take priority before advancing to more complex practices. For example, a well established Version Control system is essential before effectively implementing Deployment Solutions. By progressively strengthening each layer, organisations can drive continuous improvement to optimise the flow of high quality valuable software.

However lower level Engineering Needs do not need to reach full maturity before a higher level need may become a constraint or a focus for an organisation. And vice versa, organisation will need to continue some investment in maturing basic needs as organisation performance increases. The intensity of the needs at the different hierarchies as performance increased can be shown to be more like this overlapping graph. The level of maturity required for each is often organisation dependent.

A key principle of the HoEN model is the importance of dependencies between needs. Lower level needs serve as building blocks for higher order capabilities, meaning that attempting to implement advanced practices without a solid foundation can lead to inefficiencies, instability, or failure. For example, a well established Version Control system is essential before effectively implementing Deployment Solutions, just as robust Quality Engineering Practices must be in place before achieving Continuous Delivery.
