# Artifacts used for standardisation in software

Naming things will probably always be hard. 
These are suggested definitions and examples to help clarify and distinguish terms often interpreted differently by individuals and organizations. 
Ambiguity and confusion of these concepts can lead to friction and responsibility overlaps across teams and funcitions - e.g architecture, platform/cloud, enablement teams, communities and feature delivery teams.
The examples given are publicly available close-enough demonstrations of the concepts. Organizations invariably adapt/build/maintain their own.

## Pattern 🧩
A technology-agnostic approach to a common problem. The concept has been strongly validated as useful across industries and usecases. Something in the spirit of what Martin Fowler, might write about.

- [Feature Flag vs Feature Toggle by LaunchDarkly](https://launchdarkly.com/blog/is-it-a-feature-flag-or-a-feature-toggle/)

- [Gang of Four (GoF) Design Patterns](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/gangs-of-four-gof-design-patterns)

## Blueprint 📐
An opinionated way to implement a pattern. Examples include:
- [API Gateway Pattern by AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/modernization-integrating-microservices/api-gateway-pattern.html)
- [AWS Prescriptive Guidance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/cloud-design-patterns/introduction.html)
- [Azure Architecture Patterns](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/)
- [CGP Reference Architecture](https://cloud.google.com/architecture)

## Helper 🔧
A small, reusable tool, script, or shared library to automate repetitive tasks within a pipeline, project, or codebase setup. Often community driven. Very helpful for for implementing productivity wins and compliance requirements. Examples:
- Secret handler
- Common deploy task
- Log forwarder
- Repository linting setup

## Template 📄🌶️
Aka ___Referernce implementation___ or ___Refernece Architecture___. An opinionated implementation of a standalone component like a new pipeline, front-end app, or API endpoint—often built on a preferred blueprint. Examples:
- [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/)
- [Express Application Generator](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html)
- Your organisation's default opinion (reference implementations) on what common components/services should look like:
    - API Endpoint
    - Front end application/component
    - Queue worker / event processor

Getting to the opinions is a process, and it's not always easy. Engineering standards and a commitment to standardisation helps a lot.

## Accelerator 🤖🧶
AKA ___Golden Path___ or ___SDK___ (for public use cases)*

All the above things stitched together. A composite of templates and helpers that does as much of the required setup as possible to get a new, compliant component into production, leaving minimal stitching work for team members.
Examples include:
